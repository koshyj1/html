# html
For html code.

USE VetGuardian.web NOT VetGuardian.web copy.


To run the folder simply open up terminal or command prompt. cd into VetGuardian folder once downloaded onto computer.

example: cd User/Path/To/VetGuardian.web

Next: cd into ClientApp.

command: cd ClientApp

Next: run ng serve command to locally host website.

command: ng serve

Wait for system to compile, do not {Control, C} out of terminal, keep command running in order to host website. Check for any errors.

Next: Open safari or chrome and type in -> localhost:4200

You should be able to see the site running locally. Server is not reachable and locked, so most dependecies will be unusable -> ie. ToPromise.



Side Note; check angular website if certain dependencies are missing when running ng serve. Use commmand -> npm install <angular api to install> <- to install any needed dependencies.
